                I am a master's student in business informatics from Slovenia. 
                I feel in love with blockchain technologies in 2019, when I first invested into Bitcoin
                and I have been learning about it ever since. I first started as an investor but with
                time started to understand blockchain and its concepts, so I wanted to make my
                own projects. I first started with Moralis Academy, back then it was Ivan On Tech
                Academy. Through those courses I developed understanding of Javascript and
                using Binance Apis to retreieve the data. For some time I was all in development of
                trading bots. I made a lot of strategies programatically but I just didn’t seem

                I found this amazing 32-hour course taught by no other than Patrick Collins himself.
                Throughout the course, I developed strong understanding of solidity development
                and hardhat. From there I still wanted to get more knowledge so I started
                CryptoZombies course which I finished in no time. After I got all the knowledge I
                needed, I started doing my own projects. Here I am now, presenting my portoflio
