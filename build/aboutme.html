                    I'm Jaka, a Business Informatics Master's student proudly representing Slovenia.<br><br>

                    My journey into the captivating world of blockchain technologies began back in 2019, ignited by my initial investment in Bitcoin. Since then, my passion for this transformative technology has only grown stronger, propelling me on a relentless quest for knowledge and innovation.<br><br>
                    
                    What initially started as a curious investment soon transformed into a deep exploration of blockchain's intricacies and underlying concepts. With time, my curiosity evolved into a burning desire to actively contribute to the blockchain ecosystem through my own projects.<br><br>
                    
                    My journey began with the Moralis Academy, formerly known as Ivan On Tech Academy. Through these courses, I honed my JavaScript skills and learned how to harness the power of Binance APIs to extract crucial data. This newfound expertise led me to the world of trading bots, where I crafted numerous programmatic strategies. Yet, I yearned for more.<br><br>
